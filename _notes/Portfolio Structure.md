Tips
- **Case studies need to include designs** _**and**_ **process**
- portfolios that show a balance of process, craft, and a clear understanding of the user and the business.
- For each case study, create short sections that discuss the user problem, business goals, research, iterations on the design work, visual design, and project impact and metrics if possible. I’d also recommend noting the role, responsibilities, who else was on the team, and the project duration.
- By “show,” have images of FigJam collaboration with stakeholders and cross-functional partners, iterations of screens, and visual design. By “tell,” have 3–5 sentences (not multiple paragraphs) describing the user problem, business goals, research, and why those led to the design decisions they made.
